# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### This project was one of the first I made on React 18.2.0. The UI is in a pixel style.


# How to use this app?

- Create a list of tasks or items that you need to do in the input field with a placeholder "Add your TODO here".
- If you entered something incorrectly, click on the <b>pen</b> icon to edit the text. 
- The <b>"floppy disk"</b> button will save the edited task. 
- If a task is completed, click on the <b>checkbox</b> to mark it as completed in the list. 
- If something is not needed or was entered by mistake, delete it by clicking on the <b>trash can</b> icon.
